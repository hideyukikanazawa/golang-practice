Algorithms learned -
1. Inversion counting 
2. Strassen's subcubic matrix multiplication
3. O(n logn) algorithm for Closest Pair problem


MASTER METHOD
Motivation - Potentially useful algorithmic ideas often need mathematical analysis to evaluate
Assumptions - 
1. All subproblems have the same size
2. Blackbox method

Recurrence Format
1) Base case - T(n) <= c for all sufficiently small n
2) For larger n:
T(n) <= aT(n/b) [Recursive calls] + O(n^d) [Extra work]
    a = No. of recursive calls                                                  (a >= 1)
    b = Factor by which input size shrinks                                      (b > 1)
    d = Exponent in running time of "combine step", outside of recursive calls  (d >= 0)

Master Method

            1) O(n^d logn)      if a = b^d
T(n) =      2) O(n^d)           if a < b^d
            3) O(n^logb(a))     if a > b^d

--------------
Proof - Part 1
--------------
There are a^j subproblems, each with size n/b^j
Total work at level j   <=    a^j [# of level-j subproblems] *  c * [n/b^j]^d [Work per level-j subproblem]
= cn^d * [a/b^d]^j

Total work <= cn^d * SUMMATION(logb(n), j=0) [a/b^d]^j **


--------------
Proof - Part 2
--------------
Our upper bound of work at level j:
cn^d * (a/b^d)^j

Interpretation
=> a   = rate of subproblem proliferation           - RSP
=> b^d = rate of work shrinkage (per subproblem)    - RWS

1) RSP = RWS --> Same amount of work at each level (like merge sort)    [might expect O(n^dlogn)]
2) RSP < RWS --> Less work each level, most work at the root            [might expect O(n^d)]
3) RSP > RWS --> More work each level, most work at the leaves          [might expect O(#leaves)]
